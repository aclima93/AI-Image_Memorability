Images with a prefix of 'bin_' cannot be associated with their non-prefix counterparts.



The image with index 1 represents the best case.

For instance, bin_least_memorable1.png is the least memorable image of the binary set.

least_memorable4.png is less memorable than least_memorable5.png. 



The same reasoning follows for the the most memorable set of images.

For instance, most_memorable1.png is the most memorable image of the numerical set.

bin_most_memorable4.png is more memorable than bin_most_memorable5.png.
